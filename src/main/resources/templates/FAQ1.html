                    <li style="color: #9B2409">
                        We work quickly to find several sitters in your area. This process can take up to a week, depending on your family’s unique needs.

                    <h3>WHAT DOES YOUR SITTER SERVICE COST?</h3>
                    <li style="color: #9B2409">
                        Our pricing varies depending on the needs of each family. Pricing includes a placement fee and an hourly wage rate. This rate includes the sitter's wage, taxes and insurance coverage. Our families also enjoy access to ongoing professional guidance from Jovie placement professionals and access to our back up care services. Once we’ve learned more about your specific needs, we can offer your family a detailed quote and price range.

                        When you invite someone new into your home, you want to make sure they’re ready for anything and everything. So we bring you well-trained, qualified and simply outstanding people who are eager to help you and your family out. Our local teams train and educate each sitter. These trainings include ongoing instruction on child safety and how to have age-appropriate fun with children.
